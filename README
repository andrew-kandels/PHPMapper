PHPStateMapper is a class for generating a map of the United States with states
shaded darker to represent data in a report. It can be thought of as a visual
interpretation of "usage by state" and would be an ideal candidate for use in
reports on sales, usage, adoption, traffic, and so forth.

Usage of this library is pretty straight forward. It currently supports loading
data either via PHP or from a CSV file. Here's an example of loading data from
a CSV file:

--
require_once 'PHPStateMapper.php';
require_once 'PHPStateMapper/PHPStateMapper/Import/CSV.php';

$data = new PHPStateMapper_Import_CSV('/path/to/file', true);
$data->setNameColumn('state');
$data->setValueColumn('value');

$obj = new PHPStateMapper();
$obj->import($data);
$obj->draw(); // output a PNG with appropriate headers
